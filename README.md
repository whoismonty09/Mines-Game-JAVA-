# Mines-Game-JAVA-
Mine Games is a simple Java GUI game where the player clicks boxes to find hidden hearts. Two bombs are randomly placed on the grid. Each time the player clicks a heart, the score increases. If the player clicks a bomb, the game ends and all bombs are revealed. The goal is to collect as many hearts as possible without hitting a bomb.
